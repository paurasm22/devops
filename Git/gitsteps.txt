To perform Git operations for branching and merging, follow these steps:

1. Create a Branch
To create a new branch, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git branch <branch-name>
For example, to create a branch named feature-branch, you would run:

bash
Copy code
git branch feature-branch
If you want to create and switch to the new branch immediately, use:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b <branch-name>
2. Merge Branch
To merge a branch into your current branch, follow these steps:

Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually main or master):

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Merge the desired branch (e.g., feature-branch) into the current branch:

bash
Copy code
git merge feature-branch
3. Delete a Branch
To delete a branch after merging, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git branch -d <branch-name>
For example, to delete the feature-branch, run:

bash
Copy code
git branch -d feature-branch
If you want to forcefully delete a branch (for example, if it hasnâ€™t been merged), use:

bash
Copy code
git branch -D <branch-name>
Summary
Create a branch: git branch <branch-name> or git checkout -b <branch-name>
Merge a branch: git checkout main then git merge <branch-name>
Delete a branch: git branch -d <branch-name> or git branch -D <branch-name>
Make sure to resolve any merge conflicts that might arise during the merging process.
